# IS211_Assignment2

Used Python v3.9

Struggled with getting the program to parse more than the first entry and to write to the error log, and it's still not
clear why it was unable to complete those two tasks. It was likely a formatting-related issue as the program worked 
as expected when the code was deleted and retyped without any of the edits made during troubleshooting process.
